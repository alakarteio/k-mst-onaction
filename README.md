# k-mst-onaction

🚧 🚧 **RIGHT NOW THIS MIDDLEWARE DOESN'T WORK WITH AN UGLIFY VERSION OF YOUR MOBX-STATE-TREE STORE, LOOK A THIS MOBX_STATE_TREE ISSUE FOR MORE INFORMATIONS: [Issue #492](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/issues/492#issuecomment-340699260)** 🚧 🚧

Listen to [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree) actions and react to them !
> Make your mobx-state-tree store a real tree, not a graph

## Purpose
The main purpose is to get rid of store interdependencies and to be more into a reactive way of coding.

## Why
[you can see this issue](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree/issues/486).

What we want is to pass from an actions dependencies graph to a tree:

</center>

## Installation
 - `yarn add k-mst-onaction`
 - `npm i k-mst-onaction`

## API
### First try
  1. Import the middleware from **k-mst-onaction**: `import onAction from 'k-mst-onaction'`
  2. Write your reaction, the easiest way is to write it as a function:
  ```es6
  const dispatch = (action, tree) => {
    const { fullpath, ended } = action

    if (fullpath === '/auth/login' && ended) {
      tree.ui.router.goToList()
    }
  }
  ```
  3. Connect the middleware to your root store with `addMiddleware` from [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree): `addMiddleware(yourStore, onAction(dispatch))`
  4. Voila !

### Middleware API
As you see on the [First try](#first-try) what you have to do is to give a `dispatch` function to the `onAction` middleware.

The `dispatch` function can be of two different types:
 - **an array**, in this case, each function of the array will be called
 - **a function**, in this case the function will be called
   * if the `dispatch` function returns an array, then the middleware will iterate over the array and call each functions that compose it

You can use the `take` helper to avoid dealing with the API and have a cleaner code.

From [First try](#first-try) example code with `take` helper:
```es6
import { addMiddleware } from 'mobx-state-tree'
import onAction from 'k-mst-onaction'
import Store from './your-store-model'

// instanciate the store
const store = Store.create({})

// the actions to trigger
const dispatch = (action, tree) => [
  take.ended('/auth/login', () => { tree.ui.router.goToList() })
]

// attach the onAction middleware from k-mst-onaction
addMiddleware(store, onAction(dispatch))
```
Note that:
  - dispatch returns an array
  - we call `take.ended` which will test that the asynchronous action is ended
  - we pass the full action name (path + name) as first parameter
  - we pass the reaction as second one parameter

### Take API
`take` is an helper that takes two arguments (`take(test, reaction)`):
 - first argument is the `test`, it can be
   * **a string:** this string will be converted to a regular expression then the match is tested with fullpath
     - `'/user/add'` will work against `'/user/add/'`
     - `'/user/:id/setName'` will work against `'/user/12/setName'`
   * **a regular expression:** then the fullpath is tested over the regular expression
   * **a function:** the function is called and should return true to have the reaction called
     - the function takes two arguments: the `action` to test and the current `tree` (your store instance)
 - second argument is the `reaction`, this is **a function** with two parameters (`reaction(action, tree)`):
   * `action` is the action that pass the test (first argument of `take`)
   * `tree` is your current store instance, so you can call action on it !

### Action API
As you can see, the `action` object is given to your `dispatch` function, and to first and second parameters of `take` helper.
This `action` owns these fields:
 - **path:** the action path from the root store
 - **name:** the action name
 - **fullpath:** `path + '/' + name`
 - **ended:** for asynchronous action **only**, it means the aynchronous action is ended

## Examples
We will write 4 ways of doing a router redirection after our login is successful:
 - `dispatch` is a function (that doesn't return an array)
 - `dispatch` is a function that returns an array
   * with a not pure `take` helper function use
   * with a pure `take` helper function use
 - `dispatch` is an array

### `dispatch` is a function (that doesn't return an array)
```es6
import { addMiddleware } from 'mobx-state-tree'
import onAction from 'k-mst-onaction'
import Store from './your-store-model'

const store = Store.create({})

const dispatch = (action, tree) => {
  const { fullpath, ended } = action

  if (ended && fullpath === '/auth/login') {
    tree.ui.router.goToList()
  }
}

addMiddleware(store, onAction(dispatch))
```

### `dispatch` is a function that returns an array - impure take
```es6
import { addMiddleware } from 'mobx-state-tree'
import onAction, { take } from 'k-mst-onaction'
import Store from './your-store-model'

const store = Store.create({})

const dispatch = (action, tree) => [
  take.ended('/auth/login', () => { tree.ui.router.goToList() }),
]

addMiddleware(store, onAction(dispatch))
```

### `dispatch` is a function that returns an array - **pure** take
```es6
import { addMiddleware } from 'mobx-state-tree'
import onAction, { take } from 'k-mst-onaction'
import Store from './your-store-model'

const store = Store.create({})

const dispatch = () => [
  take.ended('/auth/login', (action, tree) => { tree.ui.router.goToList() }),
]

addMiddleware(store, onAction(dispatch))
```

### `dispatch` is an array ️❤️
❤️ This is the recommended way of using this middleware ❤️

```es6
import { addMiddleware } from 'mobx-state-tree'
import onAction, { take } from 'k-mst-onaction'
import Store from './your-store-model'

const store = Store.create({})

const dispatch = [
  take.ended('/auth/login', (action, tree) => { tree.ui.router.goToList() }),
]

addMiddleware(store, onAction(dispatch))
```
